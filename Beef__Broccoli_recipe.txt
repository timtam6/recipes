Beef & Broccoli
12 oz. (3/4 lb.) broccoli
1 lb. lean boneless beef steak (any lean cut)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup oil
2-4 tablespoons water

Stir-Fry Sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
dash cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 1/4 cups beef broth
Directions
Beef & Broccoli
Trim broccoli florets so stems are 1 to 1 1/2-inches in length. (Tip: Cutting stems on the diagonal gives the broccoli a more aesthetic look.) Cut florets as needed to create bite-size pieces. Set aside.

Trim off any excess fat from the beef. Slice beef with the grain into 1 1/2-inch-wide pieces, then thinly slice those beef pieces against the grain diagonally (this makes the slices of beef more tender). Place beef slices in a medium mixing bowl with soy sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Set aside and allow to marinade for 15 minutes.

Stir-Fry Sauce
While beef is marinating, prepare Stir-Fry Sauce: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together cornstarch, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, dry sherry and beef broth. Set aside.

Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat. When wok or skillet is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Allow oil to heat for about 30 seconds, then add the beef and stir fry until meat is browned (about 2-3 minutes). Remove beef from skillet and set aside in a bowl.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to wok or skillet. Allow oil to heat about 30 seconds, then add broccoli and stir-fry for about 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons water. Cover and cook for about 3 more minutes until broccoli is tender-crisp (taste one small piece of broccoli to test doneness). Add beef back to skillet along with Stir-Fry Sauce and stir until well blended and thickened (about 1-2 minutes).

Serve alone or over any type of rice or chow mein or other long noodles.
